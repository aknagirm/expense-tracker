# About the Application

In this application user can save their daily income and expenditure, for tracking and analysis purpose. It provides trend analysis of incoming and outgoing monetory flow by using bar graphs and pie charts.
This helps a user in maintaining a balance between spending money and saving for future purposes.
Its benefits also includes separate categories within which we can group expenses. Also for every expense , the remanining balance is shown in negative/positive which helps an individual plan for the next cost/investment.

I too use this application. And I must say , as a heavy spender myself , this app has helped me in restricting my expenditure to necesities and requirements thus being able to save up for the future. :-) ;-)
